# Basic Typescript/Javascript quiz app

This is a work in progress app I made in React for basic quizzes.

## Current goals:

1.  Add error messages (or missing question)
2.  Add scoring system
3.  Once those are complete (assuming the quiz is fully functional), make sub-app for practicing long poems or stanzas (like creeds or prayers)
4.  Make a similar quizzing sub-app for image based questions
